<h1>LAMBORGHINI TERZO MILLENIO SUPERFACTS</h1>
<ol>
    <li>This Lamborghini costs <b>2.5 million US dollars</b></li>
    <li>It has a total of <b>838</b> horsepower </li>
    <li> <b>Autonomous capabilities</b>:
        The Terzo Millennio is reported to have an autonomous system, but only for racetrack driving. This system would make the car run a full lap without any mistakes, then teach the driver how to run the lap on their own, using a ghost car, which is based on video game series such as Forza, and Gran Turismo.
        </li>
    <li><b>Electric motors</b>:
        The Terzo Millennio uses high-capacity supercapacitors in lieu of batteries, due to their more rapid storage and discharge of energy.
         These supercapacitors have been made to simultaneously capture and release energy to give the car an increase in performance, without having to depend on chemical reactions. Each wheel, the rims of which glow orange, contains an electric motor, 
         so that the amount of torque can be controlled individually, making the car's stability as good as a modern Formula One car. 
        </li>
    <li><b>Design and Body</b>:
        The car still inherits the modern Lamborghini design, with the Y-shaped design elements such as the headlights and taillights, along with the triangular front trunk and rear engine bay.
        Carbon fibre is used entirely for the body panels. The body of the car is monitored by a health system.
        </li>
    <li><b>Self Healing</b>:
        The Terzo Millennio has the ability to detect and repair cracks in its body work. Using sensors the car can conduct its own health check to detect any damages and self-repair itself by filling the crack with nanotubes to prevent it spreading
